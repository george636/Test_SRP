ANDROID REMINDER APPLICATION

TO DO:

orientation change time change fix
add more info to FAQ screen, update old info

UNDO functionality

For daily reminders do date comparison, if difference between today and last reminder date > 1 then set next reminder based on todays timestamp instead of reminder’s timestamp. this will prevent reminders going on and on if phone was turned off for few days




variable snooze length

widget

BACKUP

Sync between devices

dark theme



Expandable list view to group reminder types into:
- single occurence
- recurring
- deactivated

custom repeating reminders:
As of API 19 all repeating alarms are inexact. This causes reminders not to go off at scheduled times. Repeating every X minutes will have to be handled manually.

I IMPLEMENTED A FIX, ADDED FUNCTION IN ALARM MANAGER CALLED setNextAutoRepeat. THIS NEEDS TO BE PROPERLY TESTED. - this will not work, as this will change the actual time of reminder. this will be an issue with recurring reminders. have to come up with something else. FIX removed





- TABLET user interface

- SWIPEABLE INTERFACE (2 tabs), maybe also add it to basic version

(- CHOOSE START SCREEN, very optional)












DONE:
remove words scheduled reminders in the list activity, free and pro
MATERIAL DESIGN UPDATE

nicer looking list of reminders with custom views (material?)

MATERIAL:
add back icon
add back icon handling in all activities
add themes
remove styles
style all dialogs + custom popup
set action bar title = new reminder/edit reminder
set hint Remind me… remove top text
add shadows
add in all activities: 
//OVERRIDE METHODS
    @Override protected int getLayoutResource() {
        return R.layout.activity_new_reminder;
    }


- kbd closed after picking date or time

set vibration pattern to 50, 0, if user chose no vibration

remove commented out logs

cancel dialogs when cancel pressed

show info that reminder is inactive

make sure that keyboard opens when coming from list of reminders

add clear top on edit intents in list of reminders
PostOffice dialogs - material
reorder buttons, DELETE, EDIT, SNOOZE/CANCEL
inactive reminders to be greyed out

improve the logic for editing old reminders, keep time, but update date - look at free version

reorder snooze edit delete buttons to make sense in new popup, make order the same in the notifications menu
- fix focusing and keyboard showing
DO NOT modify time of old reminder on edit (keep time selected by user)

when creating new reminder, do NOT finish, just start reminders list activity, clear top. around line 190
weekdays reminder
weekends reminder
when any repetition chosen, change Date to "Start on Date" weekdays or weekends chosen, 
give popup on save if user wants weekdays but start date is on weekend and vice versa
check why popup brings main app sometimes = checked, does not happen in tests. will have to monitor real app
new icon type, without plus sign in the notifications = generate as notification icon
FREE Version, make visible that pro is available
preference for pop up
- REPEAT REMINDER ALARM UNTIL ATTENDED
- LED notification light
- MAKE SURE THAT REMINDERS ARE RESET WHEN repeating preference changes, this will make sure that they are set either with or without repeating, depending on user preference.
- Remove info icon and move the list reminders icon a little to the right so it is not hit accidentally
- SWIPE NOTIFICATION TO DELETE REMINDER
- ADD QUESTION ICON INSTEAD of INFO icon and it will show help panel explaining recurring reminders
- RECURRING REMINDER (this will require upgrade to DB - will need to write a functions to handle upgrade so that users won't lose data - this should be much easier with new ReminderManager)
----  SUPER IMPORTANT!!! TEST WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU SET REMINDER FOR 31ST OF A MONTH AND NEXT MONTH IS ONLY 30 DAYS. ---
DEBUG: java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start receiver com.gadgetjudge.simplestreminder.ReminderAlarmReceiver: java.lang.NumberFormatException: Invalid long: ""
Close pop up when reminder changed from notification, I added ON RESUME logic in popupdialogactivity but this won’t work as onresume is not called when slide down menu is closed
Also added cancelling - called in reminder manager, on delete function


FOR REPEATABLE:
- save original timestamp in the db or pass it as a variable 
- add field in the db that holds the value of frequency
- figure out what to do with the snooze button, delete, what gets deleted
- the way they are displayed in the list has to be different
- option to delete reminder when notification swiped away
- SOLVE ISSUE WITH LONG PRESS TO DELETE RECURRING
